# Ball Animation
This code snippet demonstrates a basic animation of a blue ball moving within a defined area on an HTML webpage. Key features include:
> A blue ball (div element with a circular appearance) is displayed on the webpage.
> JavaScript is used to control the ball's movement.
> The ball moves horizontally (along the x-axis) and vertically (along the y-axis) within specified boundaries.
> It bounces back when it reaches the edges of its designated area.
>  The animation runs at a fixed interval, making the ball move in a back-and-forth pattern.
You can adjust the animation parameters, such as velocity and boundaries, to customize the animation behavior.
